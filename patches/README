The 1 and 2 omap-mcspi patches are only needed for kernels < 2.6.34.
They were incorporated into the mainline in 2.6.34

1-omap2-mcspi-cleanup-null-ref.patch is only needed for dynamically added
spi devices. Statically added devices won't encounter the error.

2-omap2-mcspi-use-transfer-speed-override.patch allows spi devices sharing
the same SPI bus to specify their own speed in each spi_transfer. 


spidev-enable.patch is for enabling spidev in the board-overo.c file for
the gumstix. The patch was generated against the linux-omap3-2.6.34 kernel
from the OE repository. You may have to modify the patch for other kernels.
